        ## STOP - Do Not Report Security Issues Here

        **Public GitHub Issues are NOT the place for security vulnerabilities.**

        Please follow our responsible disclosure process:

        **[Read SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md)**

        ### How to Report

        Email: **jeremy@intentsolutions.io**

        Include:
        - Description of the vulnerability
        - Steps to reproduce
        - Potential impact

        ### Why Private Disclosure?

        Public disclosure of vulnerabilities can:
        - Put user funds at risk
        - Allow exploitation before fixes are deployed
        - Harm the project and its users

        We commit to acknowledging reports within 48 hours.
