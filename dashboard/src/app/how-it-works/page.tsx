    description: 'A user expresses what they want (e.g., swap 1 ETH for USDC at best price). The intent is formatted as an ERC-7683 cross-chain order with an intentHash.',

    title: 'Solver Executes',
    description: 'A registered solver picks up the intent and executes it on-chain. The solver must have an active bond (minimum 0.1 ETH staked in the SolverRegistry).',
    detail: 'Solvers choose execution strategies: direct swaps, multi-hop routing, cross-chain bridges, or aggregation. The method is up to the solver; the outcome must meet the intent constraints.',

    title: 'Receipt Posted On-Chain',
    description: 'After execution, the solver posts a cryptographic receipt to the IntentReceiptHub. The receipt includes the intentHash, constraintsHash, evidenceHash, and solver signature.',
    detail: 'V2 receipts add dual attestation: both solver and client sign via EIP-712. Privacy levels (public, semi-public, private) control what data is visible on-chain vs. stored off-chain.',

    description: 'A 1-hour challenge window begins. During this period, anyone can dispute the receipt by providing evidence and posting a dispute bond.',
    detail: 'Deterministic violations (timeout expired, wrong amount) are resolved automatically. Complex disputes use optimistic resolution: the solver has 24 hours to post a counter-bond, or the challenger wins by default.',

    title: 'Finalization & Reputation Update',
    description: 'If no dispute is filed during the challenge window, the receipt finalizes. The solver\'s IntentScore is updated based on the outcome.',
    detail: 'If a dispute was filed and resolved against the solver, the bond is slashed: 80% to the user, 15% to the challenger, 5% to the treasury. After 3 jailings, the solver is permanently banned.',
