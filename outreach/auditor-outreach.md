## Email Template - Tier 1 Firms

**Subject**: Audit Request - IRSB Protocol (900 SLOC, Intent Accountability Layer)

```
Hi [Firm] Audit Team,

We're requesting a security audit for IRSB Protocol — an accountability layer
for intent-based transactions (ERC-7683 ecosystem).

SCOPE SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Contracts: 3 (SolverRegistry, IntentReceiptHub, DisputeModule)
• SLOC: ~900
• Language: Solidity 0.8.20
• Framework: Foundry
• Tests: 95 passing
• Complexity: Medium (bonding, slashing, signature verification)

WHAT IRSB DOES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Solver registration with ETH bonds
• Cryptographic receipt posting for intent execution
• Deterministic dispute resolution (automatic slashing)
• Reputation tracking (IntentScore)

KEY RISK AREAS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Reentrancy in ETH transfers (withdrawals, slashing)
• Signature verification (receipt authenticity)
• Access control (slashing authorization)
• State machine transitions (receipt/dispute lifecycle)

RESOURCES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• GitHub: github.com/intent-solutions-io/irsb-protocol
• Audit Package: /audit/ directory (SCOPE.md, THREAT-MODEL.md, INVARIANTS.md)
• Deployed: Sepolia testnet (verified contracts)
• Dashboard: https://irsb-protocol.web.app

TIMELINE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Desired start: Q1 2026
• Mainnet target: Post-audit Q1 2026
• Flexible on timing to match your availability

BUDGET
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Please provide a quote based on scope. We're prepared for Tier 1 pricing
given the financial risk profile (bonded collateral, slashing).

Happy to schedule a call to walk through the architecture.

Best regards,
Jeremy Longshore
