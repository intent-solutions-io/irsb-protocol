# IRSB Protocol

**On-chain guardrails for AI agents and intent-based transactions.**

> Your AI agent has wallet access. IRSB ensures it stays within bounds.

---

## The Problem

AI agents are gaining wallet access through frameworks like AgentKit, ElizaOS, and Olas — but there are no on-chain mechanisms to enforce spending limits, prove what agents did, or provide recourse when they act outside their mandate. The same gap exists for DeFi solvers executing user intents.

**"What happens when the agent overspends, calls the wrong contract, or goes rogue?"**

Today: Nothing. No spend limits. No audit trail. No recourse.

## The Solution

IRSB provides on-chain policy enforcement, cryptographic receipts, and automated dispute resolution:

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **WalletDelegate + Enforcers** | On-chain spending limits, time windows, contract/method whitelists via EIP-7702 |
| **Receipts** | Cryptographic proof of every on-chain action |
| **Bonds** | Staked collateral slashable for violations |
| **Disputes** | Automated enforcement with watchtower monitoring |
| **Reputation** | Portable trust scores via ERC-8004 registry |

### Caveat Enforcers

Five on-chain enforcers validate every delegated transaction before execution:

| Enforcer | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **SpendLimitEnforcer** | Daily and per-transaction spending caps |
| **TimeWindowEnforcer** | Restrict agent signing to defined time windows |
| **AllowedTargetsEnforcer** | Whitelist of approved contract addresses |
| **AllowedMethodsEnforcer** | Whitelist of approved function selectors |
| **NonceEnforcer** | Replay prevention for each delegated action |

    F -->|Disputed| H[Evidence Review]

```

## Why IRSB?

- **On-chain policy enforcement** — Spend limits, time windows, and contract whitelists enforced at the EVM level
- **Verifiable execution** — Every action produces a cryptographic receipt
- **Framework-agnostic** — Works with any agent or solver that holds wallet keys
- **ERC-7683 compatible** — Native support for the cross-chain intent standard
- **Portable reputation** — Agent track records move across protocols via ERC-8004

| Standard | What It Does | How IRSB Connects |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **EIP-7702** | EOA delegates execution to contract code | Agents delegate to WalletDelegate for policy-enforced transactions |
| **ERC-7683** | Defines intent format | IRSB receipts reference `intentHash` from ERC-7683 orders |
| **ERC-8004** | Agent identity & reputation registry | IRSB is a **Validation Provider** — generates signals that feed the registry |
| **x402** | HTTP 402 payment protocol | IRSB adds accountability to paid APIs — receipts prove service delivery |

### IRSB + ERC-8004: Reputation from Execution

ERC-8004 stores agent identities and reputation scores. IRSB generates the validation signals that update those scores based on actual on-chain execution.

```
Agent executes action through WalletDelegate
    → Enforcers validate caveats
    → IRSB receipt posted
    → Challenge window passes
    → finalize() called
    → ERC8004Adapter.signalFinalized()
    → Agent reputation updated in ERC-8004 registry
```

### IRSB + x402: Accountability for Paid APIs

When AI agents pay for services via x402, IRSB ensures accountability:

```
Agent sends x402 payment → Service executes → IRSB receipt posted
                                                    ↓
                                            Dispute? → Slash bond
                                            No dispute? → Reputation++
```

The `irsb-x402` package handles this flow.
